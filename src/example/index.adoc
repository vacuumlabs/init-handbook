This is just an example chapter.

=== AsciiDoc Playground
AsciiDoc has a very simple syntax. Headers are
indicated by the = sign.

Paragraphs are created by leaving an empty line.

Beware,
line
breaks
are ignored.

AsciiDoc supports *bold*, _italic_, and `monospace` text.

NOTE: There is a lot of cool stuff supported by AsciiDoc. Just read the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual[ultimate user manual].

TIP: Did you know, that you can use variables like {Samo} or even links to
{handbook}[various documents^]?
